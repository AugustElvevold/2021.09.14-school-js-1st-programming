# Interactive Juice Glass

## Description
This project is my first submission in my developer career. It is a simple and interactive web application where a prebuilt HTML/CSS file becomes responsive to user input. Users can interactively fill or empty a visual representation of a juice glass by entering a number or using buttons. The application provides feedback by notifying users when the glass is full or empty, ensuring it does not go over or under the limits.
