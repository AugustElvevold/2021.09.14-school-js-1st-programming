# Interactive Juice Glass

## Description
This project is my first submission in my developer career. It is a simple and interactive web application where a prebuilt HTML/CSS file becomes responsive to user input. Users can interactively fill or empty a visual representation of a juice glass by entering a number or using buttons. The application provides feedback by notifying users when the glass is full or empty, ensuring it does not go over or under the limits.

## Description
This project is a straightforward and interactive web page where users can visually fill or empty a juice glass. As my initial project in web development, it's a playful and responsive application. Users can enter a number or use buttons to adjust the juice level in the glass. The web page provides clear feedback, ensuring the juice level stays within the glass's limits by notifying users when the glass is full or empty.
