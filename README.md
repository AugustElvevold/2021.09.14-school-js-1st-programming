# Interactive Juice Glass

## Description
This project is a simple and interactive web application where a prebuilt HTML/CSS file becomes responsive to user input. Users can interactively fill or empty a visual representation of a juice glass by entering a number or using buttons. The application provides feedback by notifying users when the glass is full or empty, ensuring it does not go over or under the limits.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, download the `juice-complete.html` file. You can view and interact with the web page by opening this file in a web browser. For the best experience, use the Visual Studio Code Live Server extension to view the live page.

## Usage
Simply navigate to the downloaded `juice-complete.html` file and open it in your web browser or using a live server. Use the on-screen controls to fill or empty the juice glass and observe the page's responsive behavior and messages.
